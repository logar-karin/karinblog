    <h3>Early years</h3>
    <p>
When I was little, I was very cunning and caused my parents a lot of trouble. I went to music school for 13 years, first I played the violin for 8 years and then I took solo singing lessons for 5 years. Now I don't have time for all that anymore, because I have a lot to learn and other everyday commitments. When I was younger I used to love skating and skiing, but now I just like to go walk in the snow and play with my dog. I didn't like primary school because it was compulsory. When I was 12, my father taught me how to ride a motorbike and I loved riding it.  My father and I were very close, but sadly he left me when I was 17 because he had cancer. I passed my car test when I was 19 and now I'm the main driver in the house.
